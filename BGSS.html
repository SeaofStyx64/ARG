  <h1>B.G.S.S Information File</h1>
  <p>The B.G.S.S, or Bureau of Global Security and Strategy, is a government body designed for the creation and implementation of security measures when regarding important government artifacts.</p>
  <p>Recently, the B.G.S.S have been performing tests on chosen subjects, to get an accurate reading on their intelligence and problem solving skills.</p>
  <p>They go under an alias known as the Birthday Gift Solving Service, a company designed to help subjects obtain a reward from completing the tests, adding incentive.</p>
  <p>The subjects are chosen based off of age, intelligence, hobbies and skill. </p>
  <p>However, due to the secretive nature of the B.G.S.S, all test subjects that fail mysteriously go missing, likely at the hands of the B.G.S.S themselves.</p>
  <p>When a subject passes the test, their names and information are recorded, and the subject is considered for future employment.</p>
  <p>The B.G.S.S are not what they seem.</p>
